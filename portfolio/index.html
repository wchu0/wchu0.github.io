            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p> Wesley Chu is a Graphic Communication major concentrating in Design Reproduction Technology with a minor in Industrial Technology in Packing at the California Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo. His dream is to become a Graphic Designer of sorts, whether it be for packaging, logo design, or product design. Wesley is trained to use multiple types of softwares in order to make this dream come true; these softwares include and are not limited to Adobe InDesign, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, and Clip Studio Paint. Other relevant software include Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word, and Adobe Lightroom.</p>
            <p>Welsey was also a member of the Chinese Students' Association of CalPoly San Luis Obispo for all four years, including one in which he served as the cultural club's Historian, or lead photographer. In this position, he refined his DSLR photography skills, learned how to use Lightroom and Photoshop to edit photos, and gained important leadership skills, all while participating as an active member of the executive board. During his time on board, Wesley worked with the Videographer to create the CSA Media Team, which gave general members the incentive and opportunity to assist CSA with photography, videography, and other miscellaneous duties that board members were previously too overwhelmed to complete. When Wesley eventually retired from the executive board, he continued to be active in CSA meetings and events, both as a general member and as a member of the newly formed CSA Media Team.</p>
